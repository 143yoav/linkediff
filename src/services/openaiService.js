I just merged a pull request that addresses several critical security vulnerabilities in our login flow. Here's what we accomplished:

âœ… Fixed a potential SQL injection vulnerability in the user lookup process
âœ… Implemented proper password hashing using bcrypt with salt rounds
âœ… Added rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
âœ… Improved error handling to prevent information leakage

These changes not only make our application more secure but also improve the overall code quality and maintainability. The team worked hard to ensure these fixes were implemented without disrupting the user experience.

Security is a journey, not a destination. What security improvements have you made to your projects recently?
